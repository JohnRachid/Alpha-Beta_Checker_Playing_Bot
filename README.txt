This project plays checkers againt a human or a bot. The bot uses alpha-beta pruning in order to make the optimal move.
The checker moves are in the Portable Draughts Notation provided by the library below. A search depth above 5 can take a
very long time to compute.

To run the code import into pycharm and run main.py within the checkers directory. Otherwise import project into pycharm
and right click main.py and select run main.py.

The project uses the following libraries with python 3.6.x:
numpy	                1.17.2
pip	                    10.0.1
setuptools	            39.1.0
six	                    1.12.0
